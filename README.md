# LibreWeather... API

Core APIs for LibreWeather/libre-weather

## Get it up and running
- Create a `.env` file in the root with your open weather map api key stored as `OWM_KEY=key-here`
- Optionally add `SCOPE` and `LOG_LEVEL` as well, for logging management.
- Run `npm i` and `npm run dev`. This will start an auto-reloading nodemon instance, serving the api at localhost:3000.

## Development
